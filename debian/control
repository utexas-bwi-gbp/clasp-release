Description: This ROS package contains the clasp answer set solver for (extended) normal logic programs developed at the University of Potsdam. Clasp combines the high-level modeling capacities of answer set programming (ASP) with state-of-the-art techniques from the area of Boolean constraint solving. The primary clasp algorithm relies on conflict-driven nogood learning, a technique that proved very successful for satisfiability checking (SAT). Unlike other learning ASP solvers, clasp does not rely on legacy software, such as a SAT solver or any other existing ASP solver. Rather, clasp has been genuinely developed for answer set solving based on conflict-driven nogood learning. clasp can be applied as an ASP solver (on SMODELS format, as output by Gringo), as a SAT solver (on a simplified version of DIMACS/CNF format), or as a PB solver (on OPB format).
